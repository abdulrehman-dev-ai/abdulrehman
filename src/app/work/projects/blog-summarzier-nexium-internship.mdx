## 🗃️ Data Models

### Supabase – `blog_summaries`

```ts
interface BlogSummary {
  id: string;
  url: string;
  title?: string;
  english_summary: string;
  urdu_summary: string;
  word_count?: number;
  reading_time?: number;
  created_at: string;
}
```

### MongoDB – `blog_contents`

```ts
interface BlogContent {
  _id: string;
  url: string;
  title?: string;
  fullText: string;
  metadata?: {
    author?: string;
    publishDate?: string;
    wordCount: number;
    extractedAt: Date;
  };
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

## 🧪 Backend API Endpoint

### `POST /api/process-blog`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/blog-post"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "title": "Blog Title",
    "englishSummary": "Generated summary...",
    "urduSummary": "اردو خلاصہ...",
    "wordCount": 1500,
    "readingTime": 8,
    "mongoId": "...",
    "supabaseId": "..."
  }
}
```

## 🧠 Challenges & Learnings

- **Blog Text Extraction**: Some blogs resist scraping, requiring smart fallback logic.
- **Translation Reliability**: MyMemory API provides free tier translation but needs retries or throttling under load.
- **Bilingual UI Support**: Displaying Urdu correctly (RTL layout) with Tailwind required careful styling.
- **Dual Data Persistence**: Coordinating writes to both Supabase and MongoDB needed atomic handling and error fallbacks.

## ✅ Results & Impact

This app offers a powerful demonstration of how modern tools and open APIs can deliver a production-grade NLP experience without relying on expensive LLMs. It simplifies research and learning by giving users an English summary and a native Urdu translation in seconds—backed by structured storage and a responsive UI.
