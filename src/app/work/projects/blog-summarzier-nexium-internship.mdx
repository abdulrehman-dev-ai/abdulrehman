## Overview

The **AI Blog Summarizer** is a real-time, multilingual content analysis tool. Built as part of Nexium’s AI Enhanced Web Internship program, it leverages the power of **Google Gemini API** to extract, process, and summarize live blog content directly from the user-provided URL. It outputs a concise English summary alongside a native **Urdu translation**, making it a dual-language educational and productivity tool.

This project demonstrates practical integration of AI with full-stack web development for enhanced user experience and accessibility.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Blog Scraping**: Dynamically extracts text from external blog URLs provided by the user.
- **AI-Powered Text Summarization**: Uses Gemini’s LLM to produce structured and relevant summaries.
- **Urdu Translation Support**: Auto-generates native Urdu translations of summaries for bilingual users.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Minimal UI with clean components, responsive layout, and interactive loading states.
- **Save Functionality** *(Coming Soon)*: Summaries can be saved for offline review and study.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js (App Router)**: Framework used for routing, API routes, and optimized server-client interactivity.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and elegant styling with a mobile-first approach.
- **Google Gemini API**: LLM-based summarization and translation engine.
- **React Hook Form + Zod**: Input validation and form handling.
- **Cheerio + Axios**: For scraping blog content and extracting clean HTML text.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Dynamic Content Extraction**: Parsing blogs reliably using Cheerio required understanding HTML patterns and noise removal.
- **Gemini Prompt Engineering**: Writing structured prompts to get high-quality, relevant summaries and translations was a key learning.
- **Handling Cross-Origin Content**: Dealing with CORS and ensuring stable API requests from different domains added complexity to the backend logic.
- **Multilingual Output Rendering**: Managing Urdu text direction (`rtl`) and font handling within a consistent UI layout.

## Outcome

This project demonstrates the power of combining **AI, NLP, and full-stack web development**. It is a prime example of how AI can automate research, assist in education, and improve digital accessibility. The AI Blog Summarizer not only simplifies content consumption but also serves as a technical showcase of **LLM integration with real-world user input**.
